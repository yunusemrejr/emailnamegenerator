# emailnamegenerator
JavaScript email name idea generator script. (includes Blogger.com platform specific classes in HTML)

I programmed this for my personal Blogger.com website (a Google product used for hosting free blogs with customizable front-end, also known as "Blogspot"),
and therefore some parts of the code are referencing to the Blogger's standard HTML classes which won't make sense in another platform. But overall it takes about a couple
lines of code change to get my new script running on a regular HTML document. Enjoy!
